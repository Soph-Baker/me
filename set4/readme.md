TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

exercise 1
the pyramid was that hardest to figure out
    i tried creating it under one code but it would fail to create a full pyramid and only the ascending part of the pyramid so i had to split it into two parts
the diarist also had some parts go wrong as there are two set4 in the 1161 folder and just had to specify the me/set4 folder
