TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.


First class was pretty clear in what we have to do and the website going through each step is very helpful if i missed a step

Had some trouble with the following two problems but 
startup not working -> needed to upgrade pip
python command not found -> forgot to put 3 after pythyon
