TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

EXERCISE 0
minitest not working
also not sure if i did the number tests correctly (probably not)
shout tests not saying completed for some stupid reason

EXERCISE 1
easy to understand

EXERCISE 2
reasonably easy to debug - all the infromation wa easily read on the exercie

EXERCISE 3
i am very confused on this

is_odd function 
    when a number is divded by 2 if it = 0 (false) it is even and if it =1 it is odd (true)
fix_it function
    if moves is true and should_move is true return no problem but if should_move is false return duct tape
    but if moves is false and should_move is true return wd-40 and if both are false return no problem
for the loops it is creating lists without writing them out continuously
